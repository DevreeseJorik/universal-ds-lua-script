# Universal DS Lua Script

Welcome to the Universal DS Lua Script repository! This library is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to manage Nintendo DS scripts for emulators such as Desmume and Bizhawk melonDS.

## Features

- Automatically detects Emulator, and loads specific version dependencies
- Automatically detect the type and language of a ROM that is loaded into the emulator (on a case by case basis, needs expanding)
- Run code specifically written for that ROM and Emulator, with a single main script
- Link keybinds to execute functions

This was originally designed for the PokÃ©mon speedrunning and glitching scene, 
with example code available for the main series DS games of this franchise.

## Installation

To use this library, simply clone or download this repository and load the main script in your Emulator of choice.
For DeSmuME this can be done through:
 Tools > Lua Scripting > New Lua Script Window ...

For Bizhawk this can be done through:
 Tools > Lua Console > Script > Open Script 
 or 
  Tools > Lua Console > Open Script (folder icon)

Simply copy the path to the main script to run it.

## Usage
