# Universal DS Lua Script

Welcome to the Universal DS Lua Script repository! This library is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to manage Nintendo DS scripts for emulators such as Desmume and Bizhawk melonDS.

## Features

- Automatically detect the type and language of any ROM that is loaded into the emulator
- Run code specifically written for that ROM
- Link keybinds to execute functions
- Designed for the Pok√©mon speedrunning and glitching scene, with example code available
- Use the same main script for all your ROMs and save time and effort

## Installation

To use this library, simply clone or download this repository and include the script in your project. 
 Currently, there are two scripts available, one for each emulator:

- [BizGrasp](BizGrasp) (Bizhawk edition)
- [GraspMuME](GraspMuME) (Desmume edition)

In the future, it is possible that a single script will be able to handle both emulators.
